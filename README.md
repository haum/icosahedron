# Icosahedron

This is a simple OpenScad model (https://www.openscad.org/) of an icosahedron that is composed of identical pieces which can be assembled together to form a complete "wireframed" solid.
You can switch between element and complete assembly with parameter `element` at 1 for the element, and anything else for the assembly.
